                <H1>About Me</H1>
                <p>First, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Scott Williamson. I'm a passionate IT Professional with a relentless curiosity for all things tech and security. Whether it's coding, hardware tinkering, or diving into the latest advancements, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
                <h2>The Purpose of the Lab</h2>
                <p>This lab serves as my creative haven, applied training environment, and personal cybersecurity lockbox to break into, where I embrace new challenges and embark on exciting journeys of exploration and learning. From testing new security frameworks to building custom hardware setups, every corner of this space is dedicated to fostering innovation and growth.</p>
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <p> In this virtual space, you'll encounter a diverse array of passion projects, experiments, and applied education covering various facets of technology. The intital datacenter was built in about 12 hours one weekend. This web page took twice as long, haha. In the coming weeks my next projects include locking this environment down according to common security frameworks, adding additional Domain Controllers, potentially more Hosts, standing up and configuring a Debian server as a network bridge firewall, and adding pages and functionality to this site. I would love to play with AI or ML here but GPUs are not cheap.</p>
                <H2>Current Studies</H2>
                <p>I'm currently studying for CompTIA's Cloud+ exam scheduled for late June '24. I've begun watching videos and Podcasts covering CompTIA's Network+ and CySA+ certifications. My ultimate goal is to have added "CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist, Secure Cloud Professional, and Security Analytics Professional" certifications to my accomplishments by the end of 2024. I may also pursue AWS, Microsoft, Cisco, or Linux certifications if I see alignment with my other interests. </p>
                <H2>Current Functionality</H2>
                <p>Work in progress..</p>

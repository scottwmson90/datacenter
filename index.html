                <H1>About Me</H1>
                <p>First, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Scott Williamson.  I'm a passionate IT Professional with a relentless curiosity for all things tech and security. Whether it's coding, hardware tinkering, or diving into the latest advancements, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible. </p>
                <h2>The Purpose of the Lab</h2>
                <p>This lab serves as my creative haven, applied training environment, and private cybersecurity landscape, where I embrace new challenges and embark on exciting journeys of exploration and learning. From implementing security frameworks and new security tools to building custom hardware setups, every corner of this space is dedicated to fostering innovation and growth. </p>
                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <p> In this virtual space, you'll encounter a diverse array of passion projects, experiments, and applied education covering various facets of technology. The initial datacenter was built in about 12 hours one weekend. This website took twice as long, lol. In the coming weeks my future projects include standing up and configuring Debian servers as a network bridge firewall and Security Event and Incident Manager, securing this environment according to common security frameworks (NIST 800), adding additional Domain Controllers, adding more Hosts, and functionality to this site. I would love to do more with AI or ML here, but the Graphical Processing Units to run it are not easy to come by. </p>
                <H2>Current Studies</H2>
                <p>I'm currently studying for CompTIA's Cloud+ exam scheduled for late June '24. I've begun watching videos and Podcasts on CompTIA's Network+ and CySA+. My goal is to add "CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist, Secure Cloud Professional, and Security Analytics Professional" to my accomplishments by the end of 2024. I may also pursue Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Cisco, or Linux certifications when I see alignment with my other interests. </p>

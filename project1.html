                <h2>Statement of Work</h2>
                <p>Install and configure available hardware to support 10-12 Linux and Windows Virtual Machines. Requirements include 3 Proxmox servers configured as a cluster with High Availability. 1 Debian Server for Firewall. 1 Debian Server for Security Event and Incident Manager. 1 CentOS server for file server. Minimum 3 Windows Servers for Active Directory, SQL database, and Web Server. 1 Ubuntu workstation for testing. 1 Kali workstation to test and verify security implementations.</p>
                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p>3x Dell Optiplex 3070: 3GHz i5-9500 CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 500BG NVMe</p>
                <p>1x Dell Optiplex 7470 AiO: 3GHz i5-9500 CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 500BG NVMe</p>
                <p>1x Dell Precision T5810: 3.1GHz Xeon E5-1607, 16GB DDR4, 500GB HHD</p>
                <p>1x Cisco SG300 switch</p>
                <p>1x Netgear PROSafe GS748T switch</p>
                <h2>Operating Systems and Software</h2>
                <p>CentOS 7</p>
                <p>Debian 12.5</p>
                <p>Kali 2024.1</p>
                <p>Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop</p>
                <p>Rufus 4.5</p>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I started by obtaining my software media. I used Rufus to write my ProxMox ISO to a USB drive. I prefer to use Rufus to create my bootable drive. I've found it helps me avoid compatibility issues when it's time to boot the machine and start installations. Plugged the drive into one of my Dell Optiplex 3070s.  I know from experience Dell machines have a trick to installing new operating systems or new hard drives for that matter. You need to go into the BIOS, open "System Configuration”, then "SATA Operation", and switch "RAID On" to "AHCI", save your changes and exit. Your new OS will fail to find the hard drive if you don’t. </p>
                <p>Rebooted to USB, I installed ProxMox using default settings and a single partition. Next, I moved on to the All-in-One. Wrote Ubuntu to a drive with Rufus. Adjusted the BIOS and booted to USB. Installed Ubuntu with default settings and a single partition. I signed into Ubuntu and tried to connect to the ProxMox dashboard. No response. Pinged the Server, no response. Connected a monitor to the ProxMox server. The WEBUI IP does not match my network. I had made a big mistake configuring the first server. I assumed the server would pull an IP address from the network via DHCP and did not pay attention to the IP configuration during installation. I checked my DHCP host and found a range of available IP addresses. Opened a Nano terminal on the ProxMox server and updated my IP address in the ETH adapter. Queue the second mistake, because this is a hypervisor I thought I needed a separate IP for the virtual switch and put a second IP in my host file. Then I rebooted the ProxMox server. </p>
                <p>Went back to my Ubuntu workstation and tried to connect to the ProxMox Dashboard IP, but there was no response, again. Tried the Adapter IP, we’re in business! I loaded up the other two Dell Optiplex 3070s with ProxMox. I used default config and single partition again but did get my IP addresses set during installation this time. I went to the first ProxMox host and built a cluster. I went to the second ProxMox host to join the cluster. “Host 1 not found.” Signed back ProxMox Host1 locally and changed my Host File IP address to match the adapter IP address and rebooted. Back to Host 2. Successfully joined Host 2 and Host 3 to the cluster. </p>
                <p>Host 1, I uploaded my Debian ISO and built my first Linux VM.  Installed Debian 12 default settings and a single partition. I kept it small, 1 CPU, 2GB RAM and 32GB Disk. Host 2, I uploaded my CentOS ISO. Same config, default settings, a single partition, 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, 32GB Disk. Host 3, I upload my Windows Server 2019 ISO. And now the fun begins. Didn’t change any settings for the Guest VM. The guest VM is a temporary host to run your installation media for your permanent Virtual Machine. I started the Windows Installation process. No disk found. </p> 
                <p>I know this can’t be hardware. I took care of that before I got the hypervisor running. I escalated the issue to Google. Took no time to discover VitrIO Driver package and that I maybe missing drivers for the disk I downloaded VirtIO and uploaded the ISO to Host 3. Added the VirtIO ISO to a virtual CD/DVD drive and restarted the VM. Restarted the Windows installation, no disk, no second CD drive. Deleted the VM and made a new one. Default settings added a second drive for the VirtIO ISO. Started the Windows install, same result. Deleted the VM again. </p>
                <p>Now I’m curious. I know I have a driver issue. I started building my VM again.  I start looking thru the guest OS options. I selected “Microsoft Windows” and “10/2016/2019”,  “Add additional drive for VirtIO drivers” and selected my VirtIO ISO. I selected a “q35” machine after a quick search on the difference between it and the “i440fx” default. I changed the BIOS to “OVMF (UEFI)” and added “TPM 2.0” to maximize my options in future projects. I set the Disk for 90GB with 1 CPU and 2GB RAM. Started my Windows installation again. Still no disk, but my VirtIO disk has shown up.  Load my disk drivers. Format my partition We’re off. </p> 
                <p>Get into my new OS, no network. I go into device manager network and unknown PCIe device need drivers. Load the network driver from my VirtIO ISO. Had to look up the PCIe device by it’s Unique ID, it’s the VirtIO Memory Balloon. Install that driver.  Queue up Windows updates. Set my hostname and reboot. </p>
                <p> Next step I add roles and features. I’m adding the Active Directory Domain Services and DNS. I’m not adding DHCP because I’m planning to use my Debian Routing Server for DHCP. I set up my domain. Add a few users. I point DNS at 127.0.0.1 & 8.8.8.8   </p>

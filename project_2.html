                <h2>Statement of Work</h2>
                <p>Install and configure Security Information and Event Manager on CentOS VM server to facilitate environment monitoring and security controls.</p>
                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p>3x Dell Optiplex 3070: 3GHz i5-9500 CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 500BG NVMe</p>
                <h2>Operating Systems and Software</h2>
                <p>CentOS 7</p>
                <p>Wazuh 4.8 Indexer</p>
                <p>Wazuh 4.8 Server</p>
                <p>Wazuh 4.8 Dashboard</p>
                <p>Wazuh Agent</p>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Well this project reminded me of a quote, Thomas Edison is credited as having said something to the effect, “I have not failed 10,000 times. I have found 10,000 ways that do not work.” We could argue the details. Some say, “100 ways”, some say “1,000 ways”. The Rutger’s Archives has a magazine interview putting the number closer to 3,000 failures for the Light Bulb. I’m only up to a few dozen failures learning my way around Linux generally and Proxmox specifically. Let’s get into it. </p>
                <p>I want to set up a System Information and Event Manager, a SIEM. System Administrators and Cyber Security Analysts rely on this tool to gather log data throughout the environment and put it into a centralized, query enabled repository to monitor for abnormal activity and Indicators of Compromise. </p>
                <p>After some research, I settled on Wazuh. “Wazuh is a free and open-source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities. It protects workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.” <a href="https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/index.html">1</a></p>
                <p>Wazuh server components are supported by CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Amazon Linux2. The Wazuh agent is available for most operating systems, MacOS, Windows and Linux as well as Solaris, AIX and HP-UX. I have selected the CentOS server I built for this installation. </p>
                <p>I signed into CentOS as Root and run “yum install updates” & “yum install upgrades”. We already have problems. Yum can’t reach the repositories to verify the packages are up to date. I ping Google. “Name or service not found.” I ping 8.8.8.8, “network unreachable”. DNS has been ruled out. I run “ip a” to check my IP Address. I don’t have one. </p>
                <p>My Windows machines on the other host are working fine. Proxmox is talking to the CentOS VM through the Console. I think my network config on Proxmox is correct. I started to Google around. Maybe my VM bridge is misconfigured. I tried setting a Static IP on CentOS. No connectivity. I tried creating a vLan on the VM bridge. Broke my access to the Proxmox Dashboard but didn’t fix the VM’s internet access. Rolled back that mess and went looking again. Found a recommendation to enable IPv4 forwarding on the VMHost to allow DHCP. Tried that setting. Nope. Finally, Reddit turned up an answer. An Admin had a similar issue. They had selected a virtual NIC for the VM that matched the Physical Host NIC and the VM had no network connectivity. The solution was to swap the Virtual NIC for a different model. I changed the VM’s NIC from VirtIO (paravirtualized) to Realtek.   Restart the VM. I have network connectivity. </p>
                <p>Run my updates successfully. Another attractive feature of Wazuh, it has an automated installation package. A handful of commands, a couple minutes and you’re up and running. I run the two Curl commands to pull down the Wazuh installer and config file. Open Config.yml in VI and enter my IP address for my server, save and exit. I started the first BASH script and installed the Wazuh Indexer. I started my Wazuh Indexer Cluster with another BASH script. Not much of a cluster, I’m only using one server to monitor a dozen or so devices on my home network. Wazuh documentation offers a method to test the Indexer and cluster connectivity, all good. </p>
                <p> I started the second BASH script and installed the Wazuh Server. I started the final BASH script and installed the Wazuh Dashboard. I tried to connect to my Wazuh dashboard from my workstation. Wouldn’t load. Following the install guide for Wazuh, I had put in my IP address during the install but forgot to update the hostname from the placeholders.  Tried to run through the install again but kept stumbling onto errors. Shutdown the VM and delete it. </p>
                <p>Starting fresh. Rebuild the VM. Check updates, check IP Address, set Hostname.  Start my Wazuh install again. Config.yml, filled out. Indexer, done. Connection test, good. Server, done. Dashboard, the Bash command failed. I made a typo in the Dashboard Hostname in the Config.yml. The problem is once you start the installation you can’t easily go back and edit Config.yml. The first command you run converts Config.yml into a series of config files that get scattered all over the file system during the installation. </p>
                <p>I shut down the VM and delete it again. Third time is the charm. Stand up my VM. Check updates, check IP address, set hostname. Pulled down the Wazuh files. Edit Config.yml. Check and recheck ip addresses and hostnames.  All good. Run Indexer script. Run the Indexer cluster check. Run the server script. Run the dashboard script. The real frustration doing this so many times wasn’t really having to start over. It was having to manually copy the randomly generated 32-character admin password every time. Lol. </p>
                <p> Connect to my Wazuh Dashboard. Nope not yet. Time to update the firewall. I was warned repeatedly during the installation, several ports need to be opened. I added tcp/443 and tcp/ 514 among others to Firewalld. We’re up and running. I setup syslog from the Cisco switch by editing the switch config with the server IP . Then editing the local config file on the Wazuh Server to receive traffic. </p>
                <p> Installing the Wazuh Agent was a breeze by comparison except for my Debian Server. I installed Wazuh agents on my 3 Windows Servers and every Windows device in my house. Download the .MSI and run 2 commands. Installing the agent on the ProxMox VMHosts was also a snap. I was able to copy paste commands to create a GPG key, add the Wazuh Repository, install the agent, create and start the agent service. </p>
                <p>The Debian server was trickier. I had to manually copy the commands into the terminal. I quickly found out my Debian server does not have Curl or gnupg2 installed, yet. I apt-install those packages. Run my command again. Success, I have a GPG key. Add the Wazuh Repository to my repository lists. Run the apt-get wazuh-agent command, error. Can’t access any repositories, not even Debian. A quick Google for the error message reveals I made a typo in the repository name. Call up the list file in Nano. Fix my typo and the two additional listings I created while troubleshooting. Save changes and exit. Run apt-get again and the Wazuh Agent is installed. Create the agent service. Started the agent service. We’re finally done.”</p>
                <p> I let Wazuh “cook” overnight. The good news is I don’t have any Critical or High Severity Alerts on my home network. The better news is I have 2800 medium severity and 16000 low severity alerts to look at. But we’ll save those for the System Hardening Project. </p>
